As part of the Flutter course I'm taking, one of the things we have to do is generate an app icon. The course talks about http://appicon.co which is a nice website that does this for you. However, with a quick Google I found a Dart pub tool that can do this for you in your project. it is called "Flutter Launcher Icons". The details of which can be found [here][pub.dev-link]. Unfortunately, the generated icon does not fill the circle on new Android devices. At least when using the image from the course, maybe I'll play around with it later and see what I can do.
