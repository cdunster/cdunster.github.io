I have decided to start learning Flutter (and therefore, Dart) to create apps for iOS and Android.
The course that will start me on this journey is "The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with DartThe Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart" on [Udemy][course-link]. It seems highly rated and the Flutter team themselves helped with the content so ðŸ¤ž it should be good.

I hope to write a series of short posts as I follow this course, these posts will mainly just act as notes for my future self, but hey the internet is a crazy place so maybe someone else will stumble upon this series and it could help them.

Wish me luck.
